## [Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_I.html)

The Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) is a collaborative project across 17 international research sites with the goal of enhancing our understanding of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The project has compiled a dataset of 1,112 individuals (539 with ASD and 573 typical controls), aged 7â€“64 years. These data include structural MRI and resting-state functional MRI, along with rich phenotypic information.

## [ADHD-200 Global Competition Dataset](https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/)

The ADHD-200 dataset is a publicly available neuroimaging resource designed to facilitate research on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the development of predictive models using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI). Released as part of the ADHD-200 Global Competition, it includes imaging and phenotypic data from 973 participants (children and adolescents) collected across eight sites. Participants are categorized into ADHD subtypes and typically developing controls (TDC), with detailed metadata such as age, gender, handedness, IQ, and clinical scores.
