# BrainGB: A Benchmark for Brain Network Analysis with Graph Neural Networks

BrainGB is a *unified*, *modular*, *scalable*, and *reproducible* framework established for brain network analysis with GNNs. It is designed to enable fair evaluation with accessible datasets, standard settings, and baselines to foster a collaborative environment within computational neuroscience and other related communities. This library is built upon [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org) and [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
